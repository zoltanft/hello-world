Practice setting up a Github repository

Here's a description of me: I'm a recent college graduate,
and I'm looking for work as a software developer. In order
to succeed in that field, though, I need to continue improving
my coding abilities past what was required of me in school.
A big part of that is personal projects, and I'll be uploading
those projects to GitHub!
